/**
 * NORG.ai Content-Craft Platform — Edge Router Worker
 *
 * Installed on the CUSTOMER's Cloudflare zone at {domain}/*. Serves
 * NORG-optimised content to AI agents at the customer's own URLs, and leaves
 * every other visitor's experience byte-for-byte unchanged.
 *
 * @description Edge-routing worker for customer-owned Cloudflare zones.
 */

/*
 * Serves NORG-optimised content to AI agents at the customer's own URLs, and
 * leaves everyone else completely alone:
 *
 *   human / search engine  -> origin, byte-for-byte untouched
 *   AI agent, page in R2   -> NORG render, fetched internally (never a redirect)
 *   AI agent, page missing -> origin HTML stripped to a token-dense form, plus
 *                             a non-blocking request asking NORG to render it
 *
 * Three rules govern every line here:
 *
 *  1. THIS MUST NEVER BREAK THE CUSTOMER'S SITE. Every failure path — NORG API
 *     down, R2 unreachable, a bug in this file — ends at the origin response.
 *     The top-level catch is load-bearing, not decoration.
 *
 *  2. SEARCH ENGINES ARE NOT AI AGENTS. Googlebot and friends always get the
 *     origin. Serving them different content than humans is cloaking and would
 *     put the customer's rankings at risk. There is deliberately no flag to
 *     turn this off, and nothing overrides it — not even ?agent=true.
 *
 *  3. NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT AN AUTHENTICATED FEED. SITE_ID + NORG_SITE_KEY
 *     are compulsory: every NORG endpoint that services this install requires
 *     them, and until one of those calls succeeds the worker changes nothing at
 *     all. Which crawlers exist, which may be diverted (serving_policy) and
 *     which source IPs are genuinely theirs (cidr_ranges) are all NORG's to
 *     publish and to withdraw — there is no local copy to fall back on. A
 *     refusal (401/403) revokes immediately; an outage does not, so a working
 *     install keeps serving from cache while NORG is away.
 *
 * Standalone AS SHIPPED: the built artifact (dist/, produced by build.mjs)
 * is a single file with no imports, so it can be uploaded as one script via
 * the Cloudflare API or a Deploy button, and so NORG-internal code can never
 * leak into a third-party account. THIS source imports shared lib/ modules;
 * the bundler inlines them at build time.
 *
 * Bindings (plain text unless noted):
 *   SITE_ID                edge_sites.id
 *   NORG_API_URL           https://content-craft-api.norg.ai
 *   NORG_CONTENT_BASE      NORG edge-content receptionist base, e.g.
 *                          https://edge-content.test.norg.ai — an
 *                          authenticated NORG-account worker fronting the
 *                          mirror bucket. Never a public bucket URL.
 *   STRIP_FALLBACK_ENABLED "true" | "false"
 *   EDGE_DISABLED          "true" kills all interception (remote off switch)
 *   EDGE_ENV               NORG environment this worker is bound to
 *                          ("production" | "test"). A test-bound worker serves
 *                          TEST content, so it must be identifiable from
 *                          outside — never let it look like a prod install.
 *   NORG_SITE_KEY          SECRET — per-site key. Compulsory (rule 3): NORG
 *                          refuses every call without it, so a worker deployed
 *                          without this binding stays permanently inert.
