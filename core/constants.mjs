/**
 * Constant tables shared with the Cloudflare edge-router worker.
 *
 * @description Provider-neutral constants for the CloudFront edge router.
 *
 * These are a deliberate COPY of the declarations in
 * `workers/edge-router-worker.js`, not an import. The Cloudflare worker's
 * bundle is pinned by SHA-256 in content-craft and its EDGE_SCRIPT_VERSION is
 * matched against a backend setting, so refactoring shared values out of that
 * file would change the shipped bundle and tell every installed Cloudflare site
 * an update is available until the backend catches up. Copying costs nothing at
 * runtime; the divergence risk is closed instead by
 * `aws/tests/constants-parity.test.mjs`, which compares the declaration text in
 * both files and fails on any drift.
 *
 * Keep every declaration below BYTE-IDENTICAL to its counterpart (modulo the
 * `export ` prefix) or that test will fail.
